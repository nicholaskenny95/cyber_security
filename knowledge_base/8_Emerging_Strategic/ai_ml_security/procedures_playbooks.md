# Procedures and Playbooks
Model Lifecycle Security
1. Data ingestion – validate source and label quality.  
2. Training – ensure isolated compute; monitor GPU workloads.  
3. Validation – test for bias, injection, and adversarial samples.  
4. Deployment – secure APIs, enforce auth, rate limits.  
5. Monitoring – detect drift and anomalies.  

Incident (Model Abuse)
1. Disable affected model endpoint.  
2. Review logs and inputs for exploitation.  
3. Retrain or patch; communicate findings.
