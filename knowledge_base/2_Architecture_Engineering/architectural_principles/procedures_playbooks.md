# Procedures and Playbooks
Architecture Review
1. Intake: design doc, data classification, threat model.
2. Assess: controls coverage vs reference patterns.
3. Decide: approve/conditional/deny with actions.
4. Record: link artifacts; schedule re-review after major change.

Threat Modeling (lite)
1. Decompose: assets, trust boundaries, data types.
2. Identify threats: STRIDE-style checklist.
3. Map controls and residual risk.
4. Track actions in backlog.
