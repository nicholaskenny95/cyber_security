# Procedures and Playbooks
## Enterprise Risk Assessment
1. Gather inputs: asset list, threat intel, vuln scans, audit findings, incidents.
2. Identify risks: scenario statement with cause → event → impact.
3. Analyze: assign likelihood and impact; compute inherent risk.
4. Evaluate: compare to risk appetite; select treatment.
5. Treat: create actions with owners, dates, residual target.
6. Monitor: update status quarterly; close when residual ≤ target.

## Change/Project Risk Review (Lite)
1. Intake via change ticket.
2. Screen for data sensitivity and external exposure.
3. Rapid score; add to register if ≥ medium.
4. Gate decision recorded before go-live.

**Escalation:** Critical risks reported to CISO within 24h with action plan.
